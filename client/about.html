                        Help Me Budget is a tool to help families budget their earnings and view a visual representation of what they are spending.
                    The software also makes suggestions on how a user should spend their money based on historical data from various sources
                    (see <a href="http://fiftythirtytwenty.com/" style="text-decoration: underline;">source</a>).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our mission is to help low income families or families without experience in finance manage their money by showing them what they are spending and giving them suggestions.
                        Many people donâ€™t have easy access to this information, so we wanted to have one website where anyone could effortlessly access assistance.
